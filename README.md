Notes on setting up a definitive nostalgic arcade machine


## PC Games

### Duke Nukem 3D

Shareware Duke Nukem works in DOSBox but cannot map controls easily. 

Full version of Duke Nukem 3D from Zoom $5.99: https://www.zoom-platform.com/product/duke-nukem-3d-atomic-edition

Running through Eduke32:

  * native Windows support
  * allows controller remapping: https://wiki.eduke32.com/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions
  * gives mouselook support but actually prefer original keyboard controls (cursor keys, fire, jump, open)

Controls:
  * joystick - cursors
  * button1 - fire
  * button2 - jump
  * button3 - open/use

### Red Alert 2

Available for free via:

### Secret of Monkey Island 2

## Sega Dreamcast

Demule for emulator. Run directly from Launchbox. Only games that use the digital cursors rather than the analogue stick are going to work well.

Flicking on load can be solved by disabling full-screen optimisations.

### Soulcalibur

Works fine.
