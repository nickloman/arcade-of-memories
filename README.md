Notes on setting up a definitive nostalgic arcade machine


## PC Games

### Duke Nukem 3D

Shareware Duke Nukem works in DOSBox but cannot map controls easily. 

Full version of Duke Nukem 3D from Zoom $5.99: https://www.zoom-platform.com/product/duke-nukem-3d-atomic-edition

Running through Eduke32:

  * native Windows support
  * allows controller remapping: https://wiki.eduke32.com/wiki/Frequently_Asked_Questions
  * gives mouselook support but actually prefer original keyboard controls (cursor keys, fire, jump, open)

Controls:
  * joystick - cursors
  * button1 - fire
  * button2 - jump
  * button3 - open/use

### Quake/Quake 2

This plays pretty well without much hassle via the Steam version with jacked up sensitivity on the trackball. The main flaw with this and Quake 2 is that you can do WASD either with the joystick or with the buttons, but there is no comfortable place for the fire button. I found a video about a company that had made a QuakeWorld cabinet and they had put a button to the bottom left of the trackball for fire, which I think would work quite well but will need an additional hole drilling!

It would work OK if you didn't use mouselook more like Duke Nukem 3D but this is generally too lame/inconsistent with how we used to play Quake/Quake 2.

### Red Alert 2

This requires a reasonable number of hotkeys to play comfortably, not sure if it's adaptable to a cabinet.

Available for free via:

### Thief 2

Available via Steam

## Amiga

### Secret of Monkey Island 2

## Sega Dreamcast

Demule for emulator. Run directly from Launchbox. Only games that use the digital cursors rather than the analogue stick are going to work well.

Flicking on load can be solved by disabling full-screen optimisations.

### Soulcalibur

Works fine.
