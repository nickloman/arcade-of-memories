Notes on setting up a definitive nostalgic arcade machine

General principles:

  * only games that we used to play when we were growing up that evoke certain nostalgia! Not just because they are on some 'best of...' list.
  * generally controllable through the cabinet controls (joystick, buttons and trackball) - should not need to revert to keyboard except in very rare cases
  * two player games favoured over single player

## PC Games

### Duke Nukem 3D

Original DOS Duke Nukem works in DOSBox but cannot map controls easily (actually you can do this via the utility programme). Atomic edition can be bought from Zoom $5.99: https://www.zoom-platform.com/product/duke-nukem-3d-atomic-edition

Easiest to run through Eduke32 which gives native Windows support and permits controller remapping from the menu. Eduke32 also gives mouselook support but I think it's better to play with the original 2.5D mode using just keyboard controls (cursor keys, fire, jump, open) but mapped to the cabinet:

  * joystick - cursors
  * button1 - fire
  * button2 - jump
  * button3 - open/use

### Quake/Quake 2

This plays pretty well without much hassle via the Steam version with jacked up sensitivity on the trackball. The main flaw with this and Quake 2 is that you can do WASD either with the joystick or with the buttons, but there is no comfortable place for the fire button. I found a video about a company that had made a QuakeWorld cabinet and they had put a button to the bottom left of the trackball for fire, which I think would work quite well but will need an additional hole drilling!

It would work OK if you didn't use mouselook more like Duke Nukem 3D but this is generally too lame/inconsistent with how we used to play Quake/Quake 2.

### Red Alert 2

This requires a reasonable number of hotkeys to play comfortably, not sure if it's adaptable to a cabinet.

## Sega Dreamcast

Demule for emulator. Run directly from Launchbox. Only games that use the digital cursors rather than the analogue stick are going to work well.

Flicking on load can be solved by disabling full-screen optimisations.

### Soulcalibur

Works fine.

## Sega Naomi

### hotd2

System soecific ROMs available from https://archive.org/download/demul07_2017/2_demul_roms_11-11-2017/

Launch demulshooter via Launchbox using additional apps on a per game basis

## Namco

### Time Crisis 2

via PCSX2. Only single player works well (split screen gun sight calibration is off). Needs 4:3 aspect ratio for decent aiming.
