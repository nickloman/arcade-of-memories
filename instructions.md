# Rauper 40 Arcade

The Rauper 40 arcade is a heavily customised arcade rig designed to take you through your childhood memories of gaming, right up to present day! Featuring a 27-inch LED screen, a Ryzen 7 5700G APU onboard PC, dual Sanwa controls and a trackball this baby can handle anything - and I mean anything - you can throw at it.

I've tried to focus specifically on games that evoke some particular memory - hopefully for you - eschewing the most choices for those games that evoke a particular nostalgia.

Anya has helped with beta testing the cabinet to ensure playability. Hannah did the artwork!

I have probably forgotten some key games, and these can be added later!

## Amstrad CPC 464

Released in 1984, I think we got one of these in 1985 (when you were 2). But you probably remember this one?

### Chuckie Egg

There are a few other games like Knight Lore, Roland on the Ropes and Sabre Wolf. But they are a bit crap now.

### Commodore Amiga 500

Released in 1987, we got one around 1988 and I know you remember a few of these.

### Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge

One of the great adventure games although most of the SCUMM engine Ron Gilbert/Tim Schafer games are available too if you have a penchant.

Playable with the in built trackball, this has aged well - Anya is into it! Use the escape key to access the load/save/quit menu. 

### Pinball Fantasies

Do you remember this one? The circus table featured P U K E lights at the top.

### New Zealand Story

I seem to remember we used to play this a lot. Who can forget this loveable little fella?

### Speedball 2

Futuristic man-machine football from The Bitmap Brothers, this plays well still as a two player.

### R-Type

Although more famously an arcade game, we definitely used to play this side-scrolling shooter a lot.

### Lemmings

"Oh no!" This was a good one we used to play in my bedroom .... 

## Sega Megadrive

We definitely had a Sega Megadrive,  but I can't really remember many games that we played on it, except:

### Golden Axe

Choose the dwarf with an axe, the tall knight, or the woman.  

### Ghosts 'n Ghouls

### Sonic

The OG Sonic, unbettered surely.

## Coin-op

My most vivid memory of playing coin-op was on holidays, like in the little "casino" in Vittel. Two games stick out for me:

### Double Dragon 2 andÂ Robocop

We spent a lot of centimes on both these guys, plus down at the Pier Arcade. 

### Bubble Bobble

What to say? I think we actually used to play this on Amiga, but the original arcade version is better so I've used that. Now although you always used to routinely beat my high score, I do note that I don't think you've ever completed the game?? Now's your chance!

### World Rally

Chris has strong memories of you playing this one on the ferry on a school trip. Playable with the stick but next job is an arcade conversion with a steering wheel....

### The Simpsons

I don't think we used to play this but I think Kerri said it was one of her favourites, and it's actually really good so I've put it on. Make sure you find all the hidden moves. Ditto NBA Jam which I have no memory of but is a stone cold banger.

### Street Fighter 2 Turbo, Tekken, Mortal Kombat

What to say really? Obligatory on a coin-op, and still fun. 

## Dreamcast

Props to Rob for reminding me that you had a Dreamcast! I don't really remember so I'm glad he reminded me because probably the most fun game to play on a cab is ....

### Soulcalbur

Surely one of the best two player beat 'em ups ever made (perhaps the best?). This plays brilliantly in emulation mode and is super fun. Anya will beat you when she plays as Sophitia.

## PC

Where it all started .... sneaking down after bedtime to play some LAN and hoping not to get caught!

### Duke Nukem 3D

Come get some! Apart from q2dm1 we can't have played any level as much as Hollywood Holocaust.

As this was a keyboard only shooter the controls still map pretty well to the cabinet joystick and buttons. Mouselook wasn't really a thing back then, and though I've used a Windows sourceport here for maximum resolution I suggest it's best keeping it off. 

Next step is to work out how to LAN my cabinet with yours for deathmatch.

### Quake and Quake 2

Included for completeness really - still best played on a desktop PC with keyboard and mouse but how could I not put these on?

The trackball is almost an acceptable substitute for mouse though so you can have some fun with it.  Likewise, I did try Red Alert 2 and Total Annihilation but games like this really need a keyboard (there is a keyboard though if you really need it!). 

## Modern Games

I've decided to include Street Fighter 6 as it just came out and looks pretty epic (hat tip to Alex D). Also Nidhogg is quite fun.

What did I forget? Plenty, probably - but there are countless thousands of ROMs on the hard drive so it's easy enough to get anything going!

I've included gun holsters for lightguns for a future upgrade!

## General Instructions

The keyboard escape key is mapped to simultaneous press of P1 start and Coin, so use that to exit any games or go back from any menus.

## General Info

The cabinet is decorated using photos by Hanah (thanks Hannah!) and contains a Ryzen 7 gaming PC designed to be completely silent and low power consumption running Windows 11. There are externally mounted volume controls (click the wheel to mute).
 
# Happy 40th Birthday!
