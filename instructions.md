# Rauper 40 Arcade

The Rauper 40 arcade is a heavily customised arcade rig designed to take you through your childhood memories of gaming, right up to present day!

I've focused only on games that evoke some particular memory - eschewing popular choices for games that have emotional meaning.

But I have probably forgotten some, and these can be added later!

So, in chronological order

## Amstrad CPC 464

Released in 1984, I think we got one of these in 1985 (when you were 2). But you probably remember this one?

### Marble Madness

Control the marble down the maze with the trackball!

### Chuckie Egg

There are a few other games like Knight Lore, Roland on the Ropes and Sabre Wolf. But they are a bit crap now.

### Commodore Amiga 500

Released in 1987, we got one around 1988 and I know you remember a few of these.

### Secret of Monkey Island 2

One of the great adventure games although all the Ron Gilbert/Tim Schafer games are available. Playable with the in built trackball, this has aged well and works perfectly. Use the escape key to access the load save menu.

### Pinball Fantasies

Do you remember this one? The circus table featured P U K E lights at the top.

### New Zealand Story

I remember we used to play this a lot. Who can forget this loveable little fella?

### Speedball 2

Futuristic man-machine football, this plays well still as a two player.

### R-Type

Although more famously an arcade game, we definitely used to play this side-scrolling shooter a lot.

### Lemmings

Oh no! This was a good one.

## Sega Megadrive

I think I got sent a free Sega Megadrive when reviewing games for The Indy, but I can't really remember many games that we played on it, except:

### Goldenaxe

Choose the dwarf with an axe, the tall knight, or the woman. 

### Ghosts 'n' Ghouls

A pretty fast side scroller.

### Sonic

The OG Sonic.

## Coin-op

My most vivid memory of playing coin-op was on holidays, like in the little "casino" in Vittel. Two games stick out for me:

### Double Dragon 2 and Robocop

We spent a lot of centimes on both these guys, plus down at the Pier Arcade. 

### Bubble Bobble

What to say? I think we actually used to play this on Amiga, but the original arcade version is better so I've used that. Now although you always used to routinely beat my high score, I do note that I don't think you've ever completed the game?? Now's your chance!

### World Rally

Chris has strong memories of you playing this one on the ferry on a school trip. Playable with the stick but next job is an arcade conversion with a steering wheel....

### Simpsons

I don't think we used to play this but I think Kerri said it was one of her favourites, and it's actually really good so I've put it on.  Don't forget to try all the different controls.

I've put a few classic games.

### Street Fighter 2 Turbo, Tekken, Mortal Kombat

What to say really? Obligatory and still fun. 

## Dreamcast

Props to Rob for reminding me that you had a Dreamcast! I don't really remember so I'm glad he reminded me because probably the most fun game to play on a cab is ....

### Soulcalbur

Surely one of the best two player beat 'em ups ever made (perhaps the best?). This plays brilliantly in emulation mode and is super fun. Anya will beat you when she plays as Sophitia.

## PC

Where it all started .... sneaking down after bedtime to play some LAN and hoping not to get caught!

### Duke Nukem 3D

As this was a keyboard shooter the controls map pretty well to the joystick and buttons. Mouselook wasn't really a thing back then, and though I've used a Windows sourceport here for maximum resolution I suggest it's best keeping it off. 

Next step is to work out how to LAN my cabinet with yours for deathmatch!

### Quake / Quake 2

Included for completeness really - probably still best played on PC with keyboard and mouse but how could I not put them on? The trackball is almost an acceptable substitute for mouse though so you can have some fun with it. 

Likewise, I did try Red Alert 2 and Total Annihilation but it's hard to make them work on arcade mode. 

## Modern

I've included Street Fighter 6 as it just came out and looks pretty epic (hat tip to Alex D).

Did I forget some? Probably - but there are countless thousands of ROMs on the hard drive so it's easy enough to get anything going!

I've included gun holsters for lightguns for a future upgrade!

## General Instructions

The keyboard escape key is mapped to simultaneous press of P1 start and Coin, so use that to exit any games or go back from any menus.

## General Info

 The cabinet is decorated using photos by Hanah (thanks Hannah!) and contains a Ryzen 7 gaming PC designed to be completely silent and low power consumption running Windows 11. There are externally mounted volume controls (click the wheel to mute).
